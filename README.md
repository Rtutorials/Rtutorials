## Welcome to Ben Hendel's Data Science Page

To whom it may concern,

I am UC Davis graduate who specializes in the intersection of data, geography, and the environment. I have been developing a skillset in R, Python, ArcGIS, and statistical modeling, and this page will be used to house projects both exploratory and educational.

### Reducing Runtimes for Support Vector Machines Digit Recognition 

The link below is a project I did that explored ways to make Support Vector Machines run faster, such as dimensionality reduction through Principal Components Analysis (PCA).

### Movie Recommendations

The link below is an analysis of movie data for 3,000 movies, as well as some attempts to predict what rating I will give a certain movie based on the movies I have already rated.
