## Welcome to Ben Hendel's Data Science Page

To whom it may concern, 

I am a young professional who specializes in the intersection of data science and geography. I have been developing skills in experiences in R, Python, SQL, ArcGIS, and statistical modeling, and this page will be used to house projects both exploratory and educational. My projects for consulting, government, and hi-tech are not public for confidentiality reasons.

### "Snowdown Showdown"

### "Lost at Six Flags"

A simulation that attempts to answer this question: If you lose someone, is it better if both people search for each other or if one searches and the other stays still? The experiment, variable conditions, and results are presented here.

### "WakeApp"

Our winning entry in the 2022 ITC Transportation hackathon, an app that alerts drivers when they doze off. Computer vision is used to detect when eyes in the image have stayed shut.

### "Wave Your Hand to Control Your Device: Creation and Feasibility Testing OS Hand Gesture Control"

This is a project report for ISYE 6740:Computational Data Analysis as part of Georgia Tech's OMSA Master's program. I used computer vision and Convolutional Neural Networks to create potentially useful automation software through webcam hand gestures connected to scripts and automation software. Several OS functions like navigating windows, controlling settings, editing text, and even controlling MIDI musical instruments

### "Food Delivery Driver Simulation: Could it save time if drivers handoff deliveries to each other mid-route?"

I always wondered if delivery drivers ever handed off deliveries each to each other if they were headed to the same destination. This project created a simulation of drivers, customers, restaurants, and routes, all corresponding to real locations within the city of Toulouse, France. We let the order queuing system run and deliver simulated orders and compared total travel time and distance to our handoff-enabled simulation. With handoffs, if two drivers crossed paths and happened to be going to nearly the same location (within a distance threshold), then one driver would give his delivery to the other, freeing him to deliver other orders and supposedly saving time and gas. Is this novel idea feasible? Watch our brief video below!
