## Welcome to Ben Hendel's Data Science Page

To whom it may concern,

I am UC Davis graduate who specializes in the intersection of data, geography, and the environment. I have been developing a skillset in R, Python, ArcGIS, and statistical modeling, and this page will be used to house projects both exploratory and educational.

The link below is to a class presentation I contributed to in 2017, looking at public school construction projects. I hope you find it valuable.
